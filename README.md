## Apache Airflow 2 for local development and CI/CD
=======================================================

&nbsp; This project is an easy-to-use development environment for Apache Airflow version 2. It can be run locally on a variety of OS platforms with simple steps for spinning up Airflow. The project can be integrated into an automated continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) process using GCP Cloud Build to build, test, and deploy workflows into GCP Cloud Composer. The project is meant to address several "infrastructure challenges" that Airflow developers experience and allows them to focus on workflow development rather than platform installation/configuration.

&nbsp; The environment is available for local use using Docker containers and Docker-Compose. For most of the deployment options, these are the only prerequisites required. The code has also been successfully tested within the GCP Cloud Shell/Editor which is an ephemeral cloud Linux instance accessible from a web browser. This may be beneficial for those who have "local PC restrictions" and cannot install docker-engine locally.

Main features of local development using Docker & Docker-Compose:

- Your workspace files are always synchronized with docker containers. With the use of an IDE program, the development process becomes easier and faster.
- Unit and Integration tests run within a container built from the same image as the Airflow deployment.

&nbsp; The project provides an opinionated Cloud Build CI/CD pipeline for the GCP Cloud Composer service. It natively integrates with a "local Airflow" development and allows developers to automatically stage, test and deploy their code into a production environment.

Main features of Cloud Build CI/CD pipeline for Composer environment:

- Container caching - reusing cache of already built images, speeds up the overall build process.
- Unit & Integration test as steps in CI stage.
- DAGs integrity validation (smoke test).
- Code linting check.
- Custom configuration: env variables, configuration, PyPi packages.
- Plugin and DAGs deployment into COmposer environment.
- Automatic email notification upon a successful build.

## 3. Customizing Airflow Settings
   ### 3.1

  - Add your Py dependencies to the `docker/requirements-airflow.txt` file

  - Adapt and install DAGs into the `dags` folder

  - Adapt and install Plugins into the `plugins` folder

  - Add variables to Airflow: `variables\docker-airflow-vars.json` file

  - Add variables to Docker containers ENV: `variables\docker-env-vars` file, the file is added to the gitignore process

  - Add variables that contain secrets and API keys: `variables\docker-env-secrets` file, the file is added to the gitignore process

  - If there is a custom Airflow configuration file ready, uncomment the line in Dockerfile in order to includ it in the image: `COPY airflow.cfg ${AIRFLOW_HOME}/airflow.cfg`

  - Optionally add the <ins>send_email.py</ins> dag to the `.airflowignore` file as this dag is only for the CI/CD part (to avoid warnings and errors during unit tests).

<br/>

### 3.2 GCP Project ID for GCP Connection

  - Set the projet-id varibale in the `variables/docker-env-vars` or `variables/docker-env-secrets` file:

     `GCP_PROJECT_ID='<project-id here>'`

<br/>

## 4. First-time initialization and service start:

  - 4.1 Open a terminal and run the following commands (use <ins>`sudo`</ins> before the command for <ins>GCP Cloud Shell</ins> and <ins>Windows WSL</ins> VMs):

        ./helpers/scripts/init_airflow.sh

    <ins>Note:</ins> &nbsp; for <strong>GCP Cloud Shell</strong> you must <strong> re-run </strong> this command every time when a shell session is expired or ended.

  - 4.2 Open a new terminal window and run the following command to make sure that all 3 containers (webserver, scheduler, postgres_db) are runnning and healthy:

        docker ps

  - 4.3 Authentificate for GCP services, run the following script and perform the gcp authentification:

        ./helpers/scripts/gcp-auth.sh

      <ins>Note:</ins> &nbsp; NOT required if you are workign via GCP Cloud Shell option, you can skip this step.

  - <strong> Airflow 2 is UP and Running! </strong>

<br/>

## 5. Commands for operations & maintenance:

  - To check if all 3 containers (webserver, scheduler, postgres_db) are running and healty:

        docker ps

  - To stop all Airflow containers (via a new terminal session):

        docker-compose down

  - To start Airflow and all services:

        docker-compose up

  - To rebuild containers (if changes are aplied on dockerfile/docker-compose):

        docker-compose down

        docker-compose up --build

  - To cleaning up all containers and remove database:

        docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all

<br/>

## 6. Running commands inside a container:

  - To run unit tests navigate to the `tests` directory and run the following command:

       `./airflow "test command"`

    example:

        cd tests && ./airflow "pytest tests/unit"

  - To run integration tests with GCP navigate to the `tests` directory and run the following command:

     `./airflow "test command"`

    example:

        ./airflow "pytest --tc-file tests/integration/config.ini -v tests/integration"

  - To spin up an Ops container with Bash session:

        ./tests/airflow bash

  - To print Airflow info:

        ./tests/airflow info

  - To lauch a python session in Airflow:

        ./tests/airflow python

  - To access the Airflow Web UI:

     `localhost:8080` or  `Web Preview` (GCP Cloud Shell)
